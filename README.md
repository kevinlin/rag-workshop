## Development Setup (using uv)

This section describes how to set up a development environment using `uv`.

### 1. Install uv

`uv` is a fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust. You can install it by running one of the following commands in your terminal:

Using curl:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Or, if you have pip installed:
```bash
pip install uv
```

For other installation methods, please refer to the [official uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

### 2. Run the Setup Script

Once `uv` is installed, navigate to the root of this repository and run the setup script:

```bash
sh setup_uv_env.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a virtual environment named `.venv` in the project root.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Install all necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Install all development dependencies from `requirements-dev.txt`.

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

After the script completes, the virtual environment `.venv` will be created. To activate it in your current terminal session, run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active. You can now run the application and development tools.

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
```bash
deactivate
```
